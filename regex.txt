Introduction

This regex implementation is backwards-compatible with the standard ‘re’ module, but offers additional functionality.
Note

The re module’s behaviour with zero-width matches changed in Python 3.7, and this module will follow that behaviour when compiled for Python 3.7.
Old vs new behaviour

In order to be compatible with the re module, this module has 2 behaviours:

    Version 0 behaviour (old behaviour, compatible with the re module):

    Please note that the re module’s behaviour may change over time, and I’ll endeavour to match that behaviour in version 0.
        Indicated by the VERSION0 or V0 flag, or (?V0) in the pattern.
        Zero-width matches are not handled correctly in the re module before Python 3.7. The behaviour in those earlier versions is:
            .split won’t split a string at a zero-width match.
            .sub will advance by one character after a zero-width match.
        Inline flags apply to the entire pattern, and they can’t be turned off.
        Only simple sets are supported.
        Case-insensitive matches in Unicode use simple case-folding by default.

    Version 1 behaviour (new behaviour, possibly different from the re module):
        Indicated by the VERSION1 or V1 flag, or (?V1) in the pattern.
        Zero-width matches are handled correctly.
        Inline flags apply to the end of the group or pattern, and they can be turned off.
        Nested sets and set operations are supported.
        Case-insensitive matches in Unicode use full case-folding by default.

If no version is specified, the regex module will default to regex.DEFAULT_VERSION.
Case-insensitive matches in Unicode

The regex module supports both simple and full case-folding for case-insensitive matches in Unicode. Use of full case-folding can be turned on using the FULLCASE or F flag, or (?f) in the pattern. Please note that this flag affects how the IGNORECASE flag works; the FULLCASE flag itself does not turn on case-insensitive matching.

In the version 0 behaviour, the flag is off by default.

In the version 1 behaviour, the flag is on by default.
